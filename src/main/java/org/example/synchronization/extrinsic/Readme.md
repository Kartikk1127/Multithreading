We will create an extrinsic lock on  
```withdraw()```
This method allows a thread to attempt a withdrawal for a specified amount from a shared balance, while handling multithreading safely using extrinsic locks. 

**Lock Acquisition Attempt:**

1. The thread tries to acquire the lock using lock.tryLock(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).
2. This means the thread will wait up to 1 second to acquire the lock. If it can’t get the lock within that time, it will give up and move on, preventing indefinite blocking.  

**Safe Withdrawal Check:**

1. After successfully acquiring the lock, the thread checks if the balance is greater than or equal to the requested amount.
2. If sufficient, the thread proceeds to withdraw after simulating a delay (Thread.sleep(3000)) to mimic transaction processing.  


**Thread Sleep Simulation:**
Thread.sleep(3000) is used to simulate some processing time (like real banking systems), making the multithreading effects (e.g., waiting, locking) more observable.  

**Balance Update and Lock Release:**
After deduction, the lock is released in a finally block, ensuring the lock always gets released even if an exception occurs.  

**Handling Insufficient Balance:**
If the balance is insufficient, it simply logs a message and doesn't perform any withdrawal, and no lock release is needed here because the lock was never acquired.  

**If Lock Not Acquired:**
If the thread fails to acquire the lock within 1 second, it logs a message saying it couldn't acquire the lock, allowing it to move on instead of being stuck.  

**Interruption Handling:**
If the thread is interrupted during its wait for the lock or while sleeping, it handles the interruption gracefully by setting the thread’s interrupted status with Thread.currentThread().interrupt().
